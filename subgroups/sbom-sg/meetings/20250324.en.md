[SBOM Generation and Evaluation Using the OSS Review Toolkit](https://qiita.com/K-Hama/private/473c631933f2c0996e8f)

## Shared Issues

- Redundancy and Volume in SBOM Generation Results  
  - The SBOM generation output includes information down to the source code and file level, which causes an extremely large output and results in redundant data.  
  - Duplicate information appears in multiple sections, making it difficult for users to extract the necessary details.  
  - Inconsistent output fields and the inclusion of unnecessary information increase the filtering workload during subsequent automated processing or manual reviews.

- Accuracy and Determination of License Information  
  - Scanning tools produce license information that is inconsistent, with many ambiguous entries marked as "NOASSERTION", making precise license determination challenging.  
  - There is variability in the reliability of automatically obtained license data, necessitating final human review and rule-based verification.  
  - The methods for confirming license information, as well as handling SBOM generation items (e.g., concludedLicense or creationInfo), lack flexibility and customization options.

- Dependency Management and Package Retrieval Issues  
  - Obtaining dependency information from both the source code and package files creates duplicate and redundant data, complicating overall dependency analysis.  
  - Analyzing solely using lock files or package manager logs may not fully reflect the latest or transitive dependencies.  
  - Inconsistent and non-automated analysis methods require manual supplementation to accurately extract and maintain dependency correlations.

- Lack of Interoperability and Flexibility Between Tools  
  - Tools like ORT (OSS Review Toolkit) can use alternative scanners (e.g., FOSSology instead of the default ScanCode), but practical examples of such switches are rare, so compatibility remains unclear.  
  - Documentation and guidelines to enhance tool interoperability are insufficient, forcing users to understand and adjust for each tool’s specific behavior.

- Internal Structure and Extensibility of SBOM Generation Tools  
  - Many SBOM generation tools have proprietary internal structures with limited public disclosure of their workflows, making extension and customization challenging.  
  - Some tools depend on external libraries or integrations with other tools; changes in internal logic may impact system-wide compatibility.  
  - There is a lack of configuration options for user-specific output formats and feature enhancements, necessitating a more flexible approach.

- Challenges in Container Image Analysis  
  - The multi-layered structure of container file systems complicates the extraction of necessary information.  
  - Depending on whether a container is in an installed state or if only the extracted root filesystem (image) is available, the analysis target may vary, hindering a unified process.  
  - Unique container dependencies and package manager details might not be fully captured, potentially affecting the precision of SBOM generation.

- Integration of Vulnerability Information and CPE Matching Issues  
  - There is no clear definition of how vulnerability information should be incorporated into each SBOM entry or what constitutes a definitive match.  
  - To comply with regulations or internal policies, manual reviews and metadata adjustments are ultimately required.  
  - Although adherence to the CPE specification is recommended, incomplete or variably provided information can lead to missing or non-standard interpretations of required fields.

- Maintenance, Updates, and Community Collaboration of Tools  
  - Some tools suffer from insufficient maintainers or contributors, leading to suboptimal maintenance.  
  - There is a lack of standardized guidelines and measures to achieve compatibility and uniform output with commercial tools.

- Readability of Output and Review Burden  
  - The standard SPDX output file is difficult to read, indicating a need for dedicated GUIs or visualization tools.  
  - Manually reviewing the automatically generated results increases the workload.

- Lack of Unified Quality Standards and Guidelines  
  - There is no established consensus on the level of detail that SBOM generation tools should capture or the format in which data should be provided.  
  - Discussions are needed to standardize and automate the user verification process.
