# SBOM Quality Guide Discussion - Meeting Notes

## 1. Integration and Purpose of the Guide
- It was agreed within Japan Community to revise the guide based on the existing OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide into a format-independent, industry-independent document.
- As a high-quality SBOM, the benefits during actual operations, such as license management and vulnerability management, should be described. It was confirmed that the final goal and the desired state (for example, taking into account the time and cost required for the tasks, resulting in a reasonably high-quality SBOM) must be clearly defined.

## 2. Unification of Terminology and Clarification of Examples
- It was decided during the review that the terminology used throughout the guide needs to be standardized.
- Since the current SPDX specification contains deficiencies in the sample descriptions and the JSON schema, this guide will include specific key mappings and enhanced examples to facilitate verification by users.
- Appendices will contain concrete examples such as JSON samples and tables mapping fields to values.

## 3. Information Sharing between Upstream and Downstream and Contract Considerations
- For SBOMs, the information provided by upstream suppliers and the methods of incorporating that information downstream—as well as the legal and contractual obligations—are important.
- Taking into account contracts and regulations (e.g., CRA), the approach will be to present best practices in the form of suggestions like “this description meets the requirements” rather than being overly prescriptive.

## 4. Content and Expression in Descriptions
- The discussion touched on differences between terms such as guide, guidance, and guideline, with the consensus that the tone for users should be advisory rather than imperative, i.e., “this would be ideal” rather than commands.
- To clarify technical specifics, such as tool identifier versions and detection of invalid email addresses, it is requested that actual JSON samples and correspondence tables be provided.

## 5. Document Preparation and Assignment of Responsibilities
- After drafting the initial version, a review will be conducted among the participants to standardize the writing style and content. Initial assignments will be decided through voting on Slack.

## 6. Discussion on the Table of Contents and Structure of the Guide
- Overall, it was confirmed that the guide will be structured with the following chapters:
  - Chapters 1 to 4:  
  These chapters will follow the existing Telco SBOM Guide as a basis.
  - Chapter 5:  
  It will first define “What constitutes a high-quality SBOM?” (Reference: [What is a high quality SBOM](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-a-high-quality-sbom)). Subsequently, it will include specific metrics, activities, and points of attention regarding quality evaluation and improvements, thereby presenting best practices.
  - Chapter 6:  
  This chapter will examine quality management and checking methods through automation. Depending on further review, it may be integrated with Chapter 5.
  - Chapter 7:  
  This chapter will cover management of the guide document itself.
  - Chapter 8:  
  This chapter will list references.
  - Appendix:  
  It will include examples of what the document might look like when written using SPDX or CycloneDX, providing JSON samples as best practices.
