## Shared Issues

1. Lack of Accuracy in SBOM Information  
   There is a lack of consistent and accurate information about package details such as package names, versions, and supplier names because different departments or providers use varying formats.  
   - Differences in Package Name Notation  
     Even for the same component, different vendors or departments might list slightly different names. For example, one company might mix the official name with abbreviations, include spelling mistakes, or vary between uppercase and lowercase letters, making it difficult for the recipient to consistently identify the component in the SBOM.  
   - Differences in Version Information Notation  
     For the same component, one source might list "1.0.0" while another might use "v1.0" or other formats, resulting in inconsistent version representations that can cause ambiguity.  
   - Variations in Supplier Names  
     Similarly, supplier names might vary. Official company names, abbreviations, or even outdated names that do not reflect mergers or acquisitions can be present, leading to an overall lack of consistency.

2. Inconsistency of Component Granularity  
   When receiving SBOMs from multiple suppliers, one SBOM might provide detailed information at the file level, while another might compile data at the package level. This inconsistency in granularity requires the recipient to normalize the data.

3. Insufficient Source Information When Binaries Are Provided  
   When receiving a binary along with its SBOM, detailed information about the source files (such as file listings, hash values, change histories, etc.) is often missing, making it challenging to manage vulnerabilities or assess risks.  
   - Listing of Source Files  
     A list detailing which source files are included in the component.  
   - Hash Values of Source Files  
     Hash values (e.g., SHA-256) for each file to prevent tampering and ensure integrity.  
   - License Information  
     Information about the license and copyright associated with each source file.  
   - Patch or Diff Information  
     Details on modifications or patches applied to the source code.  
   - Build Environment and Configuration Information  
     Data regarding the build environment, such as which compilers or build options were used.  
   - Dependency Information  
     Details about other libraries or components that this source code depends on.

4. Lack of Integration with Vulnerability Information  
   There are cases where the component or library information listed in the SBOM is not adequately correlated with known vulnerability information (such as security advisories, CVEs, or PSIRT reports).  
   - Lack of Integration between SBOM and Vulnerability Databases  
     Since there isn’t a consistent method to automatically link each SBOM entry (e.g., package name, version, supplier details) with subsequently discovered vulnerability information (for example, CVE numbers or vulnerability details), it becomes difficult to pinpoint which vulnerability affects which software component.  
   - Inconsistency in Reporting Channels and Contact Points  
     When vulnerability information is provided internally (via PSIRT or a security team) or externally, there is often a lack of clarity regarding where in the SBOM this information should be incorporated, or which department should handle it. This can delay communication and hinder prompt responses during vulnerability discovery and mitigation.

5. Mismatch in Information Sharing and Coordination Between Upstream and Downstream  
   There is often a disconnect between the SBOM provided by upstream vendors and the information managed by the manufacturer assembling the final product.  
   - Use of Different Formats or Standards  
     When the SBOM format or the security management standards of each company differ, it becomes challenging to uniformly interpret and reconcile the information, causing the assessment of risk or the need for countermeasures to rely heavily on individual discretion.  
   - Disjointed Internal Processes  
     If there is no routine process for information updates or feedback between the upstream vendor (providing the SBOM) and the downstream final product manufacturer or security team (handling vulnerability information), it can hinder early detection or impact evaluation of vulnerabilities.

6. Unclear Accountability in Contracts or Internal Processes  
   There is an issue over ambiguity regarding how much information should be requested within contractual obligations for SBOM provision, and who should be responsible (e.g., quality control or PSIRT) for addressing inquiries if internal communication processes are insufficient.

7. Diversity in SBOM Formats and Standards  
   Currently, multiple formats (SPDX, CycloneDX, JSON, Excel, etc.) exist without unified quality guidelines or evaluation criteria, resulting in variable judgment on the recipient side.

8. Difficulty Ensuring the Trustworthiness of Altered SBOMs  
   Sometimes the SBOM generated by a vendor is different from the one generated from an in-house build at the manufacturer. This discrepancy makes it challenging to assess the impact on vulnerability evaluation and risk management.  
   - Lack of Transparency in the Modification Process  
     When an SBOM is modified through several departments or tools after its initial generation, if the modification history or details are not adequately recorded or disclosed, it becomes difficult to verify whether the final SBOM matches the original source.  
   - Risk of Human Error in Manual Modifications  
     If the SBOM is manually corrected or supplemented, there is a high risk of input errors or inadvertent modifications, which can lead to divergence from the original, accurate information, compromising reliability.  
   - Variability in Automatic Generation Processes  
     When multiple automated tools or processes are involved in generating the SBOM, the differences in the output format or content among tools may inadvertently result in loss or alteration of information during integration or editing.  
   - Overlooking of Vulnerability Information Due to Modifications  
     Altered SBOMs might omit or edit crucial details regarding vulnerabilities or dependency information that should be included, leading to inadequate internal or external security assessments.

9. Lack of Clear Definition for Additional Information Expected in an SBOM  
   For example, there is no clear standard definition for the specific items (such as hash values, timestamps, or listings of source files) that should be included in the SBOM. This leads to each company providing different sets of information, further complicating subsequent analysis or vulnerability assessments.

10. Insufficient Update Mechanisms and Contact Points  
    When vulnerabilities are discovered, the absence or lack of a centralized contact point (such as a PSIRT department) and an effective communication mechanism regarding the SBOM information can cause delays in information transmission.  
    - The checklist includes whether the SBOM is updated, including the display of update timestamps and a clearly indicated inquiry contact point.

## Proposed Solutions and Automation Considerations

1. Lack of Accuracy in SBOM Information
