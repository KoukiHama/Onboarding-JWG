# Report of the study on exchanging license information between organizations

### written by OpenChain Japan work group

## 1. Backgroud of the work

OpenChain project defines the OSS compliance process in an organization. 
However, many issues have been recognized in the interface between organizations, because of lack of consensuss. 
OSS license information exchanged between organizations is different in each organization. 

In addition, sometimes, an OSS community does not provide adequate OSS license and copyright information. 
This may cause issues in down stream integrators, which cannot comply with OSS license without exact information.
