## Shared Issues

1. Unclear Scope and Boundaries of Documentation  
   - It is not defined what should be documented as detailed values in the SBOM.  
   - The boundaries between source code, binaries, ROM code, firmware, and hardware components are ambiguous.  
   - There is uncertainty between device vendors and software vendors over which information falls under each party’s responsibility.

2. Complexity in Representing Relationships between Components  
   - There is no unified method for describing the origin, links, and dependencies among components.  
   - There is confusion concerning the relationship types such as dynamic versus static linking.  
     For example, SPDX defines relationship types like "generates", "contains", "dependsOn", and "hasDynamicLink" with basic guidelines on when to use each. However, in practice, different teams and tools use these definitions inconsistently.

3. Diversity of SBOM Formats and Documentation Items  
   - There is no industry-wide agreement on which details (e.g., download locations, build histories, origins) are mandatory.  
     Opinions differ among industry stakeholders and vendors on whether the NTIA minimum definition is sufficient or if additional specific details should be included. The NTIA minimum provides a basic framework, and further discussions are needed to agree upon more detailed information and its documentation method.  
   - There is a demand for standardization of the content based on the SBOM generation tools and guidelines.

4. Challenges in Automation and Its Operation  
   - The automation mechanisms for tracking and recording each element (component or module) are not fully established.  
   - For small-scale developers or suppliers, the burden of detailed documentation can be significant.  
   - Ensuring consistency during the integration process among multiple companies and tools is difficult.

5. Accountability and Issues in Managing the Entire Supply Chain  
   - The origin of the information documented in the SBOM (who writes it and who is responsible) is unclear.  
   - In cases of vulnerability discovery or other issues, it is ambiguous who should take action.  
     Since the SBOM creator or package supplier information might be altered in the supply chain or replaced with tool names, responsibility becomes unclear when issues occur.  
   - There is a lack of standardized regulations or operational methods across the entire supply chain.

6. Handling Vulnerability Information and Update Timelines  
   - There is no defined standard for what vulnerability information should be documented for both detected and undetected issues.  
   - There are issues regarding the timing of updates, the method for reflecting change histories, and determining the boundaries for documentation.  
     - Opinions differ on whether every single change in source code, binary, or individual components should be documented in detail, or if only major changes suffice.  
     - A detailed change history may make the SBOM excessively large, potentially making it difficult for end users to locate the required information.  
     - On the other hand, insufficient change history makes tracking modifications during an incident, and thereby assigning responsibility, more challenging.

7. Challenges in Integrating Hardware and Software Component Representations  
   - There is no clear rule on how to integrate information regarding embedded software and hardware components provided by device vendors.  
   - The method for expressing differences between externally supplied drivers and internally embedded drivers is not standardized.  
     - Externally supplied drivers, provided independently by third-parties or external groups, require clear documentation of their origin, version control, and update information. In contrast, internally embedded drivers are integrated into the system or device, making individual identification and detailed documentation challenging.  
     - Among participants, there is variance in how much detail should be reflected in the SBOM regarding these differences, and a standardized operational rule is sought.  
   - For internally embedded drivers, where the driver becomes part of the overall system (for example, treated as a kernel package), individual version management or change history is often lost in the product’s overall update information.  
     - In many cases, internally embedded drivers are managed and customized in-house, and a standard format for separating and recording detailed information is not in place.

8. Differences in Design Perspectives: Purpose of SBOM and Its Intended Users (Humans vs Tools)  
   - It is not clear whether the SBOM is intended as a detailed document for humans or as a dataset for machine parsing, which affects the content and presentation format.  
   - The focus is not yet clearly defined.  
     - Human-oriented documentation requires detailed explanations and background information, while machine-read documents need a standardized, simple format.  
     - For automated tools, strict field definitions and a unified format are critical, yet overly detailed information might complicate parsing and processing.  
     - Ultimately, whether to prioritize human readability or machine processing will significantly affect documentation items, update methods, and operational costs, necessitating industry-wide agreement.

9. Lack of Consistency with Industry Standards and Regulations  
   - There is debate about how to incorporate or extend international standards (e.g., SPDX) and their defined relationship types into the documentation.  
   - There is concern that documentation practices may diverge in different workplaces.  
     - One viewpoint argues that adopting the fields and relationship definitions specified by SPDX, thereby maintaining international standardization and compatibility, is preferable.  
       In this approach, additional details would be treated as supplementary information or addressed within the existing SPDX framework.  
     - Another viewpoint holds that the basic SPDX framework does not cover all the detailed information (e.g., extensive change histories or specifics regarding internally embedded components) required in practice and thus needs extension or customization.  
     - The discussion continues over which approach is more practical.

10. Issues of Practicality and Operational Costs  
    - Demanding too much detail in the SBOM may increase operational or generation costs.  
    - Excessive or insufficient documentation might compromise its practical usefulness for end users.
