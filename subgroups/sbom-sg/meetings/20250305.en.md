## Shared Issues

Refer to the [20250305](./20250305) folder.

## Shared Issues

- Inconsistent Naming of OSS and Components  
  - For example, even for the same OSS, differences in letter case, spacing, or abbreviation usage make it difficult to accurately match records later.

- Inaccurate Version and Revision Information  
  - Variations between products (e.g., v12.3 versus just 12.3) and inconsistent notation for the same component lead to difficulties in matching with vulnerability data.

- Issues with a Manual SBOM Creation Process  
  - When using manual formats (such as Excel or Word), data entry relies on individual judgment. This can result in errors, omissions, or variations in the recorded information.

- Concerns about the Accuracy and Verification of Automated Generation Tools  
  - There is an insufficient checking system to ensure that SBOMs generated by automated tools are accurate. With a mindset that “if it is generated, it is acceptable,” there is a risk that incorrect information might be adopted without proper verification.

- Unclear Approach to Meeting Regulatory Requirements (e.g., FDA)  
  - The method for recording required items—for example, support level, end-of-support dates, and license information—is not clearly defined. This ambiguity undermines the credibility of the submitted documentation.

- Insufficient Reflection of Security-Related Information  
  - It is often unclear which parts of vulnerability data or information extracted from binaries are accurately reflected, or when “NO ASSERTION” is used. This raises doubts on whether the information is truly machine-readable and useful.

- Lack of Internal Check Systems and Audit Processes  
  - The current approach of “ask an expert when in doubt” does not establish a defined procedure or audit criteria for handling errors and omissions, leaving the process vulnerable.

- Difficulty Integrating Information Across the Entire Supply Chain  
  - There is a misalignment between the SBOM that follows internal guidelines or contractual requirements and the security or license data needed for actual operations. This creates challenges in information sharing among departments.

- Risk of Inappropriate Practices Influenced by Tool Vendors or Sales  
  - In cases where sales or vendors promote expensive tools by claiming “this will resolve the issues,” there is a risk that the tool’s output will be accepted without sufficient verification—even if the output is inaccurate.

- Mixing of OSS License-Specific Information with Security Requirements  
  - OSS licenses often require information intended for human reading, while security requirements demand data optimized for machine processing. It remains unclear which unified format should be used to satisfy both needs.

- Challenges for Future Scale-Up and Automation  
  - Automating the creation and updates of an SBOM is hindered by the current inconsistencies in manually entered data, necessitating a major overhaul of the existing process.

- Risk That the SBOM Remains a “Submission-Only” Document without Guaranteeing Accuracy or Compliance  
  - If errors exist, the responsibility for corrective action and follow-up is unclear, posing significant risks from a management and legal standpoint.
