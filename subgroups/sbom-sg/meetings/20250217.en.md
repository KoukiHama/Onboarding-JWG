## Shared Issues

1. Insufficient Dependency Information  
   In the current SBOM, not all packages that have dependencies are fully represented, making vulnerability management difficult.  
   - Although the main SBOM generated for a package records sufficient information for that package itself (name, version, build details, etc.), there are cases where a Source SBOM is provided, and other libraries or components that are relied upon during build or runtime may not have their information collected or recorded.  
   - Even with a Build SBOM, there is a potential issue where the SBOM output by the build system is limited to the packaged artifacts only and does not automatically capture information about external packages (e.g., libraries, plugins, modules) upon which there is a dependency, due to limitations both in the tool and its operation.

2. Inadequate/Incomplete Recorded Details  
   The information entered as values in the SBOM is often incomplete, making tasks such as license management and matching vulnerability information challenging.  
   - License-related information  
     - License identifiers or version details may be ambiguous (e.g., simply “GPL” is recorded without specifying the exact license version)  
     - The license may be recorded using non-standard IDs (such as those unique to a particular tool) or may not adhere to the SPDX Short Identifier format  
   - Build Information  
     - Details such as build ID, build timestamp, or information about the build system and host are not necessarily required; this renders tracking of vulnerabilities more difficult.  
   - Supplementary Information  
     - There are cases where additional information is recorded using SPDX v2.3’s Annotation Field or through free-text inputs, resulting in inconsistencies and inaccuracies.

3. Diversity of Information and Lack of Standardization  
   - To properly manage licenses and track vulnerabilities, there may be additional information required beyond the NTIA minimal elements (e.g., build options or environmental details).  
     However, there is no standard determining in which situations which information is necessary or how each field should be populated.  
   - Some tools lack adequate support for specific programming languages or package managers, resulting in variations in the information collected and the fields used to record it, depending on the tool.  
   - In the supply chain, packages may be customized or repackaged, which can lead to inconsistencies with the original build information and result in inaccuracies regarding dependencies and details.

4. Challenges in Tamper Detection and Update Processes  
   There is a possibility that the SBOM itself might be altered (either through tampering or updates), and it is difficult to build an automated process for re-retrieval or validation of authenticity.  
   - There are no established methods for verifying whether the SBOM information itself has been tampered with.

5. Difficulties in Automation  
   Currently, the outputs generated by tools require final verification (review) and adjustments by humans, making complete automation challenging.  
   Even if a system automates processes, human intervention is required for handling customized scenarios, minor environment-dependent differences, or ambiguities, which overall limits the efficiency of total automation.

## Proposed Solutions and Automation

1. Insufficient Dependency Information  
   - Checkpoints  
     - The recording status of the target package’s basic information (name, version, build details)  
     - Whether external libraries, plugins, modules upon which the target package depends are recorded  
     - Understanding of the provided SBOM types and consistency between them  
     - The scope and coverage of dependency information automatically retrieved by the tool  
   - Solutions (Process/Mechanism)  
     - Integrate a feature into the build process that automatically extracts dependency information (e.g., linking with package management tools or source control systems)  
     - Utilize both Source SBOM and Build SBOM complementarily, and establish a mechanism to retrieve transitive dependencies from the source code level  
     - Regularly review dependency data to ensure no omissions and develop a checklist for detecting missing information  
   - Automation Feasibility  
     - Automatable: Automatically extract and map dependency information based on standard formats provided by package management tools through tool integration  
     - Manual Verification: Necessary for customized or repackaged scenarios that include subtle, non-standard dependencies

2. Inadequate/Incomplete Recorded Details  
   - Checkpoints  
     - License information: presence of identifiers, explicit version details, and adherence to the SPDX Short Identifier standard  
     - Build information: unique build IDs, timestamps, and detailed records of the build system/host environment  
     - Supplementary information: consistency and accuracy of entries in free-text or Annotation Fields  
   - Solutions (Process/Mechanism)  
     - Establish mandatory recording rules for each item as industry-agreed guidelines or checklists, and standardize outputs based on formats such as SPDX or CycloneDX  
     - Introduce automated validation tools to issue alerts or error checks when deficiencies are detected  
     - Standardize the review process with templates or auxiliary tools that help complete free-text sections  
   - Automation Feasibility  
     - Automatable: Use automated validation against standardized data formats to detect missing or inconsistent data and generate alerts  
     - Manual Verification: Required for free-text fields or non-standard entries needing final quality assurance and semantic verification

3. Diversity of Information and Lack of Standardization  
   - Checkpoints  
     - Check for the presence of NTIA minimal elements as well as additional required information (e.g., build options, environmental details)  
     - Confirm differences in field outputs among various tools  
     - Ensure consistency with original build information even when repackaging or customization occurs within the supply chain  
   - Solutions (Process/Mechanism)  
     - Develop guidelines within the industry or community to agree on “mandatory fields” and “additional information”  
     - Standardize mapping rules and conversion logic among various tools to automatically consolidate outputs into a standardized format  
     - Establish operational rules and audit processes to ensure original build information is not lost during repackaging or customization  
   - Automation Feasibility  
     - Automatable: Convert tool outputs into standardized formats and automatically map and verify collected data against predefined checklists, including suggesting candidates for missing information  
     - Manual Verification: Necessary to handle specific project or environment variations and to automatically detect and reconcile discrepancies arising from customizations in the supply chain

4. Challenges in Tamper Detection and Update Processes  
   - Checkpoints  
     - Whether the SBOM is provided with a digital signature or hash value  
     - The status of audit logs for detecting corruption or tampering  
     - The existence of processes for regular updates and redistribution  
   - Solutions (Process/Mechanism)  
     - Implement digital signatures, certificates, or hash-based integrity checks during SBOM generation  
     - Establish an automated monitoring system that continuously validates signatures and issues alerts in cases of suspected tampering  
     - Formalize the update process (e.g., regular redistribution protocols) and consider integrating it with automated distribution systems  
   - Automation Feasibility  
     - Automatable: Automate integrity checks using digital signatures and hash validation, continuous monitoring with automated alerts  
     - Manual Verification: Maintain human oversight for access management, overall prevention measures against tampering, and final validation when suspicious modifications are detected

5. Difficulties in Automation  
   - Checkpoints  
     - The accuracy of automatically generated SBOMs: ensuring there are no missing items or inconsistencies  
     - Identification of items requiring correction by automated checks  
     - The coordination status between automated tools and the human review process, and clarity of the review workflow  
   - Solutions (Process/Mechanism)  
     - Implement automation tools (such as checklists and alert systems) for systematic data collection, validation, and automated formatting/conversion of outputs  
     - Establish a hybrid model that combines automation with human review, wherein human intervention is focused on anomalies detected by automated checks  
     - Apply standard templates or mapping rules to automation tools to harmonize differences in outputs across various tools  
   - Automation Feasibility  
     - Automatable: Automate standard processes for data collection, format conversion, and checks to detect inconsistencies; generate alerts and standardized reports automatically  
     - Manual Verification: Essential for areas requiring human judgment (e.g., customized or environment-specific nuances, free-text semantic verification), thereby making complete automation impractical without human final review
